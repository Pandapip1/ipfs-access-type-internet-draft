     Definition of the Multiaddress MIME External-Body Access-Type
                    draft-multiaddraccesstype-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a new access-type for message/external-body
   MIME parts for human-readable multiaddresses (multiaddrs).
   Multiaddrs provide future-proof, composable, and efficient content
   addresses.  An initial list of supported protocols can be found in
   the multiaddress specification.

1.  Introduction

   The Multipurpose Internet Message Extensions (MIME) define a facility
   whereby an object can contain a reference or pointer to some form of
   data rather than the actual data itself.  This facility is embodied
   in the message/external-body media type defined in [RFC1521].  Use of
   this facility is growing as a means of conserving bandwidth when
   large objects are sent to large mailing lists.

   Each message/external-body reference must specify a mechanism whereby
   the actual data can be retrieved.  These mechanisms are called access
   types, and [RFC1521] defines an initial set of access types.

   Multiaddresses, or multiaddrs, also provide a means by which remote
   data can be retrieved automatically.  Multiaddrs support addresses
   for any network protocol, are self-describing, conform to a simple
   syntax, have human-readable and efficient machine-readable
   representations, and encapsulate well.  For the purposes of this
   document, human-readable multiaddrs are used since they are more
   formally defined.

   Multiaddrs are exclusively used for content addressing, so
   considerations about only using mechanisms that retrieve data do not
   apply.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

4.  IANA Considerations

   This draft adds the following access type to the Access Types
   registry of [RFC4289]:

             +==================+===========================+
             | Access Type Name | Reference                 |
             +==================+===========================+
             |        multiaddr | [I-D.multiaddraccesstype] |
             +------------------+---------------------------+
